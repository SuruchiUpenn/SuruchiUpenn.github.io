### Computational Design of Advanced Materials


My particular interest lies in exploring the design principles of functionalized nanomaterials that have industrial applications.   
Self-cleaning “superhydrophobic” (extremely water repelling) materials that are employed in everything from solar panels to electronics’
screens, anti-corrosive metal surfaces to microfluidic devices, is an excellent example of a material utilizing features at nanoscale.
Another such example is nano-porous membranes used for water desalination (filtering out salt from sea-water). 
However, the study of these nanomaterials using macroscopic models is often challenging as fluctuations in the averaged properties 
(due to the motion and behavior of individual particles) begin to have a significant effect on the behavior of a system. 
This challenge often comes in the way of envisaging the design principles for creating these nanomaterials. 


### Superhydrophobic Surfaces
Owing to a water contact angle greater than 150° and an effortless rolling off of water droplets, 
superhydrophobic surfaces exhibit self-cleaning, drag reducing and anti-icing properties. 
Such qualities of superhydrophobic surfaces make them revolutionary materials desired in myriad industrial 
applications and have spurred the discovery of numerous ways for texturing hydrophobic surfaces. 
It is now well established that superhydrophobicity derives from texturing of hydrophobic surfaces; 
the aversion of water for the hydrophobic surface prevents wetting of the surface texture, and stabilizes a Cassie state, 
in which a water droplet resides on the tips of the surface asperities.
